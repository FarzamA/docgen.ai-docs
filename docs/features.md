## 🎮 How It Works

- The game starts at a 1.00x multiplier.
- The multiplier increases in real time.
- A randomly determined "crash point" is hidden from the user.
- If the user cashes out before the crash, they win their bet multiplied by the current multiplier.
- If they wait too long, the game crashes and they lose their bet.

## 🔐 Provable Fairness

**Provable Fairness** is a cryptographic guarantee that ensures every crash result on the platform is unbiased and tamper-proof. This system allows users to independently verify that the outcome of each round was generated fairly—without any manipulation from the server or client.

Key features of our implementation:

- Every round is determined using a combination of **Server Seed**, **Client Seed**, and **Nonce**, hashed using HMAC-SHA256  
- A **Server Seed Hash** is published *before* the round starts, locking in the outcome  
- After the round ends, the **Server Seed** is revealed, allowing users to verify the crash point  
- A built-in **Crash Point Verifier** lets users input the seeds and nonce to validate results themselves  
- All rounds are stored and visible in the **Provably Fair** audit log for full transparency  
- The fairness logic is open and documented—every player can inspect how crash points are calculated  

Together, these features ensure that trust is not assumed—it’s *provable*.
